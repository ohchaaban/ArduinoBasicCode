# Arduino Basic Coding (ABC)
Created by Omar Chaaban
04 Feb, 2018



Hello! This repository have been created to teach and provide helpful Arduino Basic Sketches.

Basically, I improve code to make the Arduino performs as best as possible in different thing like blink leds, read a button or both at the same time. 

You can use my code as you want as long as you respect my effort. So please, just give me my respective credit if you use or modify my code.  



I explain all this code and share coding tips @ChaabanProjects on my Instagram's highlights.
